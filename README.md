pySim - SIM card utility
====================================================

> pySim reads and writes data to programmable SIM/USIM cards.

This is useful particularly if you are running your own cellular
network and want to issue your own SIM/USIM cards for that network.
For most pySim features, you will need a *programmable* SIM card and
sufficient credentials (ADM PIN). You cannot re-program the SIM cards
issued by your mobile operator.

`pySim-shell.py` is the main script. It supports reading and writing in
an interactive shell. The scripts `pySim-read` and `pySim-prog`
exist for more specialized use-cases like bulk-programming. If you are
unsure where to start, use `pySim-shell`.

Installation
------------

Clone from the official repository ([cgit](http://git.osmocom.org/pysim/)):
```
git clone git://git.osmocom.org/pysim.git
```

Install the Python dependencies (see [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt)), e.g., using `pip`:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

You're ready to run `./pySim-shell.py`

Usage
-----

Check out the [pySim User Manual](https://people.osmocom.org/laforge/tmp/pysim-doc-test/html/). Alternatively, try `--help` for command line options or call `help` within the shell.
```
./pySim-shell.py --help
```

```
